# AND Digital Coding Exercise

This test is designed to provide a real-world scenario for you to autonomously complete to the best of your ability.

You are to complete as much as you see fit to [delight](https://and.digital/who-we-are/) us. 
Please bare in mind this needs to be **production-ready code**.

**You are expected to spend around 2-4 hours on this test. This should give you enough time to come with a good, working solution.**

## Requirements

You will need to build a web application or API that integrates with the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)
and allows you to search for a place by name and return the **recommended or popular** venues near that location.

You can display the results as you see fit, be it a properly formatted JSON with correct data structures or a web app.

## Rules

*   You will need to [sign up as a Foursquare developer](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps) and create an app in order to use their services.
*   You can use any language, platform, framework or libraries you think will get the job done.
*   Follow Agile coding principles, don't over-engineer!
*   Development best practices are followed.
*   We must be able to build and run your code without any errors (be it at compilation time or runtime).
*   Please submit your code by creating a repository on GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket and providing us with the link to the repo.
*   **You must check in your code at least once every 30mins.**
*   When you submit your code **you must send a summary (or have it as your README.md) explaining the approach you have taken.**

## Bonus Credit

*   Using a build tool to build the code and fetch dependencies.
*   Use a test runner to run the tests.
*   Create a deployable artifact or deploy within a container.

## We Are Looking To Improve

We would like to improve this test for future candidates, if you could provide us with some feedback on how you feel this test experience was for you that would be great.
